# Configuration

Most users only need `om install`. This page explains the knobs behind it.

## Env File

The main config file is:

```bash
~/.config/observational-memory/env
```

On Windows:

```text
%APPDATA%\observational-memory\env
```

`om install` creates this file with owner-only permissions. The CLI loads it at startup, including when hooks and scheduled jobs call `om`.

Environment variables already set in your shell win over values in the file.

## Save Money: Use Your Subscription

If you already pay for ChatGPT Plus / Pro / Team / Enterprise or for SuperGrok, you can point `om` at that subscription instead of an API key. Observations and reflections then ride on a plan you already paid for, with no per-token meter.

| Provider         | Auth                       | Default model           | Marginal cost per call |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `codex-cli`      | Existing `codex login`     | `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`   | $0 (your plan)         |
| `openai-chatgpt` | ChatGPT subscription OAuth | `gpt-5.5`               | $0 (your plan)         |
| `xai-oauth`      | SuperGrok OAuth (PKCE)     | `grok-4.3`              | $0 (your plan)         |
| `xai`            | `XAI_API_KEY`              | `grok-4.3`              | Metered                |
| `openai`         | `OPENAI_API_KEY`           | `gpt-4o-mini`           | Metered                |
| `anthropic`      | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`        | `claude-sonnet-4-5`     | Metered                |

To sign in, run `om login` and pick your provider. Tokens land in `~/.config/observational-memory/auth.json` (0600, host-local). `om` never writes back to `~/.codex/` or `~/.grok/`; if you already have those CLIs, run `om login --import` to copy their tokens into om's own store.

`om auth status` shows what is currently configured (tokens are redacted to the last 4 characters). `om auth refresh` forces a refresh now. `om logout [provider]` clears stored tokens.

## Provider Settings

Local Codex CLI with an existing ChatGPT login:

```bash
OM_MEMORY_DIR=~/Documents/obsidian/observation
OM_OBSERVATION_DAILY_DIR=~/Documents/obsidian/observation
OM_LLM_OBSERVER_PROVIDER=codex-cli
OM_LLM_OBSERVER_MODEL=gpt-5.3-codex-spark
OM_CODEX_CLI_REASONING_EFFORT=low
OM_REFLECTOR_CATCHUP_ENABLED=0
```

This provider runs an isolated `codex exec --ephemeral` process. It disables
hooks, memories, project rules, and write access for the worker, then reads only
the observer prompt supplied by `om`. It does not copy OAuth tokens or require
an API key. Run `codex login status` before using it. The last setting keeps an
observation-only setup from automatically running the reflector; omit it to
retain the default daily reflection catch-up.

When `OM_OBSERVATION_DAILY_DIR` is set, the observer writes one
`YYYY-MM-DD.md` file per day plus `INDEX.md`. A hidden
`.observations-materialized.md` compatibility view keeps reflection, export,
backup, and search code working without making the growing aggregate the
user-facing document. Each observer call reads only the daily files represented
by the new transcript.

Direct Anthropic:

```bash
OM_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OM_LLM_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
```

Direct OpenAI:

```bash
OM_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OM_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

OpenAI ChatGPT subscription (Plus / Pro / Team / Enterprise):

```bash
OM_LLM_PROVIDER=openai-chatgpt
OM_OPENAI_CHATGPT_MODEL=gpt-5.5
# Optional overrides:
# OM_OPENAI_CHATGPT_BASE_URL=https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex
# OM_OPENAI_CHATGPT_CLIENT_ID=app_EMoamEEZ73f0CkXaXp7hrann
```

Tokens come from `om login openai-chatgpt` (OAuth device-code against `https://auth.openai.com`). Calls route to the Codex backend at `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`. This backend is **not** a plain Chat Completions endpoint — `om` talks to it via the **Responses API** (`/responses`) with the streaming, `store=false` request shape the Codex CLI uses, and sends Cloudflare-clearing headers (`originator: codex_cli_rs`, a `codex_cli_rs` User-Agent, and `ChatGPT-Account-ID` from your token). Refresh happens automatically when the cached token is within 120 seconds of expiry, plus once on any 401 response.

The set of models the Codex backend accepts for ChatGPT-account auth is an undocumented, shifting allow-list. As of 2026-05-23 it included `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex`, and `gpt-5.2`; `gpt-5-codex` was **not** accepted. The default is `gpt-5.5`; set `OM_OPENAI_CHATGPT_MODEL` if the allow-list moves and you see an HTTP 400 "model is not supported". `max_tokens` is not forwarded to this backend (it rejects the parameter).

xAI Grok subscription (SuperGrok):

```bash
OM_LLM_PROVIDER=xai-oauth
OM_XAI_OAUTH_MODEL=grok-4.3
# Optional overrides:
# OM_XAI_OAUTH_BASE_URL=https://api.x.ai/v1
# OM_XAI_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=b1a00492-073a-47ea-816f-4c329264a828
# OM_XAI_OAUTH_REDIRECT_PORT=56121
# OM_XAI_OAUTH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
```

Tokens come from `om login xai-oauth` (loopback authorization-code + PKCE against `https://auth.x.ai`). The flow ports the upstream Hermes implementation verbatim (`nousresearch/hermes-agent` `hermes_cli/auth.py` blob `5fd3676`, 2026-05-23), including:

- `plan=generic` + `referrer=observational-memory` on the authorize request
- S256 PKCE with the `code_challenge` echoed at the token step (xAI's #26990 quirk)
- a manual-paste fallback for SSH / Cloud Shell / Codespaces (`om login xai-oauth --manual-paste`)
- `*.x.ai` host pinning on the discovered endpoints **and** the inference base URL — a tampered `OM_XAI_OAUTH_BASE_URL` cannot exfiltrate the bearer
- HTTP 403 from the token endpoint maps to `xai_oauth_tier_denied` with a clear hint to switch to `OM_LLM_PROVIDER=xai` + `XAI_API_KEY`

xAI Grok with an API key (metered fallback):

```bash
OM_LLM_PROVIDER=xai
XAI_API_KEY=xai-...
OM_XAI_MODEL=grok-4.3
# Optional:
# OM_XAI_BASE_URL=https://api.x.ai/v1
```

Anthropic on Vertex AI:

```bash
OM_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic-vertex
OM_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=my-gcp-project
OM_VERTEX_REGION=us-east5
OM_LLM_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
```

Anthropic on Bedrock:

```bash
OM_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic-bedrock
OM_BEDROCK_REGION=us-east-1
OM_LLM_MODEL=anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0
```

`OM_LLM_PROVIDER=auto` (the default) resolves providers in this order:

1. `anthropic` if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set
2. `openai` if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set
3. `openai-chatgpt` if `om login openai-chatgpt` tokens exist
4. `xai-oauth` if `om login xai-oauth` tokens exist
5. `xai` if `XAI_API_KEY` is set

Existing API-key users see no behavior change. New users discover the subscription paths via `om install`, `om login`, and `om doctor`.

Model precedence:

1. `OM_LLM_OBSERVER_MODEL` or `OM_LLM_REFLECTOR_MODEL`
2. `OM_LLM_MODEL`
3. provider default

### Different providers per workflow

The observer runs often (hooks, schedulers) and suits a fast, cheap model; the reflector runs rarely and suits a stronger one. Pin a provider per workflow:

```bash
OM_LLM_OBSERVER_PROVIDER=xai-oauth      # fast model for frequent observe
OM_LLM_REFLECTOR_PROVIDER=openai-chatgpt # strong model for durable reflect
```

When a per-workflow provider is set, that workflow uses it directly (no model-name inference), and its model resolves from the per-step override (`OM_LLM_OBSERVER_MODEL` / `OM_LLM_REFLECTOR_MODEL`) or that provider's default — **not** the global `OM_LLM_MODEL`, which usually belongs to a different provider.

### Observer context budget

Every observe run re-sends part of `observations.md` for dedup context. `OM_OBSERVER_CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS` (default `12000`) caps how much of the recent tail is sent so input cost doesn't grow with the file. Set it to `0` to send the whole file.

This cap only takes effect when OM Cluster is enabled, where observations are an append-only record log and `observations.md` is a materialized view — a bounded context can't lose history. In non-cluster mode the observer rewrites the whole file, so the full existing content is always sent regardless of this setting.

### Reflector context budget

The reflector folds new observations into `reflections.md`. For large observation sets it works in chunks, re-sending the running document on each fold — without a bound that cost grows with the number of chunks. `OM_REFLECTOR_CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS` (default `48000`) caps how much of `reflections.md` is re-sent as context. The default comfortably fits a target-size reflections file (the prompt aims for 200–600 lines), so the cap only trims documents that have grown past target. Set it to `0` to disable the bound.

When the cap does trim, it keeps the head of the document (durable identity and active projects sit at the top) and logs a warning. In single-pass reflection it bounds only the *input* context — the reflector still emits a complete document — so a normal run never shrinks your stored memory, and raising the cap restores the full context.

#### Per-call input budget

The chunked path (only reached for very large observation sets) shares one per-call input budget between the reflections context and the observation chunk. Two knobs control it:

```bash
OM_REFLECTOR_MAX_INPUT_TOKENS=45000        # per-call input ceiling (~3.5 chars/token)
OM_REFLECTOR_OBSERVATION_CHUNK_RATIO=0.6   # fraction of the budget for the obs chunk
```

`OM_REFLECTOR_MAX_INPUT_TOKENS` (default `45000`) is the ceiling for one reflector call, converted to chars at ~3.5 chars/token. The default is sized so the *effective* reflections context cap is not silently clamped below the configured `OM_REFLECTOR_CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS` (default `48000`): observations get the chunk ratio of the budget, and what remains — after the system prompt, auto-memory section, and a fixed wrapper allowance — leaves room for the full configured cap. `OM_REFLECTOR_OBSERVATION_CHUNK_RATIO` (default `0.6`) is how much of that budget goes to the observation chunk on each fold; larger chunks mean fewer folds and less repeated re-sending of the reflections context.

If you lower the input ceiling (or raise the chunk ratio) far enough, the effective reflections cap can drop below the configured one. When that happens the warning reports **both** values plus the binding ceiling, so you can tell which limit is actually clamping the context:

```text
configured_reflections_cap=48000 effective_reflections_cap=12143 max_input_tokens=12000 observation_chunk_budget=25200
```

Here the operator set `OM_REFLECTOR_CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS=48000`, but a low `max_input_tokens` clamped the effective cap to `12143`. Raise `OM_REFLECTOR_MAX_INPUT_TOKENS` (or compress `reflections.md`) to let the configured cap bind again. For very large memory the deeper fix is the section-targeted strategy below.

#### Folding strategy

`OM_REFLECTOR_STRATEGY` (default `auto`) picks how the reflector folds new observations into `reflections.md`:

```bash
OM_REFLECTOR_STRATEGY=auto   # auto | legacy | sectioned
```

- `legacy` — single-pass when the input is small, otherwise chunked: each chunked fold re-sends a bounded prefix of the running document. Simple, but the re-sent prefix grows with both the number of chunks and the document size, and once the document outgrows one fold's input budget the prefix is head-truncated every fold (older sections stop being seen).
- `sectioned` — section-targeted folding. Each fold routes its observation chunk to the reflection sections it touches (using headings, repo/project names, paths, and keywords — no extra LLM call; abbreviated names like `hermes` match a `hermes-agent` entry), sends only those sections plus an always-visible durable core bundle (Core Identity, Preferences & Opinions, Relationship & Communication, Key Facts & Context, the matching project entry, and Recent Themes when the update is about current work), then reassembles the full document byte-for-byte from the unchanged sections. Per-fold resend stays proportional to the touched sections, not the whole document, so it scales to large memory. An existing project entry is updated **in place** (only that one `### ` subsection changes; its siblings and parent header are preserved byte-for-byte); a genuinely new project is added as a new section. Invalid model output fails closed: the affected fold is skipped and `reflections.md` is left unchanged rather than written partially. The reflector can only patch the exact handles it was offered for that fold — a section it was not shown can never be replaced — so it cannot accidentally drop an unrelated section.
- `auto` — the default. Uses `legacy` while the document still fits inside the legacy chunked path's effective per-fold reflections cap (the smaller of `OM_REFLECTOR_CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS` and the budget-derived cap — about 48k with the defaults), and switches to `sectioned` once it grows past that — exactly the point where `legacy` would otherwise head-truncate every fold.

Set `legacy` or `sectioned` explicitly to override the automatic choice. An explicit `sectioned` is honored even for a small corpus that already has sections (it is not silently downgraded to a whole-document rewrite). OM Cluster reflection always uses the `legacy` cross-machine merge path regardless of this setting, so multi-machine snapshot merges keep their reconciliation guidance.

### Reflector output cap

`OM_REFLECTOR_OUTPUT_MAX_CHARS` (default `200000`) caps the reflector's *output* — the document it emits — applied after the model returns. The reflector prompt already carries a length budget, but a strong reasoning model can blow past it, and the `openai-chatgpt` (Codex) Responses backend rejects `max_output_tokens`, so nothing API-side bounds the result on that path. This cap is provider-agnostic: it runs in the reflect pipeline where the synchronous and async (Batch) paths converge, so it covers every backend, Codex included.

The default is deliberately generous. A target-size `reflections.md` (200–600 lines) is well under it, and even the runaway run that motivated the cap emitted about 121k chars — so the default only fires on a genuine runaway, never on a normal run. When the output does overrun, the pipeline trims back to the last complete `## ` section heading before the cap (never mid-section, which would leave a half-written entry in `reflections.md`), appends a truncation marker, and logs a warning naming the cap. Set it to `0` to disable the cap.

The cap applies only to legacy single-pass / chunked output, where the model can genuinely run away. Section-targeted (`sectioned`) output is a deterministic reassembly of byte-faithful unchanged sections plus a few bounded patches — it is bounded by construction, so the cap is skipped for it. (Trimming a large reassembled document at a `## ` boundary would otherwise drop untouched tail sections, which sectioned mode exists to prevent.)

### Latency: Codex reasoning effort

ChatGPT Codex (`openai-chatgpt`) accepts a reasoning effort — `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh`. Lower effort cuts `gpt-5.5` latency sharply. Observe runs default to `low` (it's frequent and latency-sensitive); reflect is left at the backend default to protect consolidation quality. Override globally or per operation:

```bash
OM_OPENAI_CHATGPT_REASONING_EFFORT=low            # all Codex calls
OM_OPENAI_CHATGPT_OBSERVER_REASONING_EFFORT=low   # observe only (default)
OM_OPENAI_CHATGPT_REFLECTOR_REASONING_EFFORT=medium  # reflect only
```

Unrecognized values are ignored (the backend default is used), so a typo can't fail a call.

### Prompt caching

On the metered Anthropic providers (`anthropic`, `anthropic-vertex`, `anthropic-bedrock`), the stable observer/reflector system prompt is sent as a cacheable block (`cache_control: ephemeral`), so repeat calls reuse it at a fraction of the input cost. OpenAI and xAI cache eligible prefixes automatically — no configuration needed. The ChatGPT Codex backend does not expose cache controls, so its instructions are sent as-is.

Cached tokens are folded into the recorded prompt-token total (see `om usage`), so usage accounting stays accurate with caching on. Cost is still estimated at the flat input rate — the per-token cache read/write discounts are not separately modeled, so a cached call's estimate is a slight over-estimate of true spend.

### Seeing what will run

`om status` and `om auth status` both show the resolved provider, the model each workflow will use, your stored subscription tokens (redacted), and a warning when subscription tokens exist but `auto` resolution is still using a metered API key (set `OM_LLM_PROVIDER` or re-run `om login` to fix).

## Usage, Cost, and Budgets

Observational Memory records every LLM call so you can see what `observe` and `reflect` actually cost, and stop a runaway job before it burns a budget. This is host-local: the data lives in `usage.sqlite` next to your memory files and is never synced through OM Cluster.

### What gets recorded

Every call through the LLM layer writes one row: timestamp, provider, model, operation (`observer` / `reflector`), prompt/completion tokens, an estimated USD cost, latency, retries, status, and the repo it ran in. Subscription-backed calls (`openai-chatgpt`, `xai-oauth`) record their tokens but cost `$0.00` — they are paid for by your flat subscription.

Token counts come straight from the provider response. The ChatGPT Codex streaming path reports usage on its final event; when a provider gives no usage object, OM falls back to a `chars/4` estimate (marked `token_source=estimate`).

```bash
om usage status                 # totals, budgets, and pricing snapshot on one screen
om usage status --since 2026-05-01 --json
om usage tail --limit 20        # the most recent calls, newest first
```

Turn tracking off entirely with `OM_USAGE_TRACKING=0` — no database is created and the only overhead is a single env check.

### Budgets

Budgets are user-side guardrails. Declare them with the wizard or set them directly; they are stored in your env file.

```bash
om usage budget                              # interactive: scope, window, caps, hard/soft
om usage budget set --daily-usd 5.00
om usage budget set --operation reflector --daily-usd 1.00 --soft
om usage budget set --monthly-tokens 5_000_000
om usage budget clear --operation reflector
```

A budget is named `OM_BUDGET_[<OPERATION>_]<WINDOW>_<UNIT>`:

- `OPERATION` (optional): `OBSERVER` or `REFLECTOR`; omit for a global cap.
- `WINDOW`: `DAILY`, `MONTHLY`, or `SESSION` (one `om` process).
- `UNIT`: `USD` or `TOKENS` (enforced independently).

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `OM_BUDGET_DAILY_USD=5.00` | $5/day across all operations |
| `OM_BUDGET_REFLECTOR_DAILY_USD=1.00` | $1/day for reflect only |
| `OM_BUDGET_DAILY_TOKENS=2_000_000` | 2M tokens/day |
| `OM_BUDGET_MODE=hard` | `hard` blocks; `soft` warns. Per-budget override: `<KEY>_MODE` |
| `OM_BUDGET_SOFT_THRESHOLD=0.8` | warn once spend reaches 80% of a cap |
| `OM_BUDGET_BYPASS=1` | one-shot escape hatch for a single call |

Before each call, OM estimates its cost (prompt `chars/4` plus the requested output cap) and checks it against current spend. A **hard** cap refuses the call with a clear message; a **soft** cap proceeds but warns. To push one call through a hard cap, prefix it: `OM_BUDGET_BYPASS=1 om reflect …`. `recall` makes no LLM call today, so it carries no budget.

A model with no price (not in the snapshot or your overrides) has no dollar estimate, so a **USD** cap can't gate it — use a **token** cap (enforced from token counts regardless of pricing) if you want a hard ceiling on unpriced models.

### Pricing

Cost estimates use a dated pricing snapshot shipped in the package. Override any model per host — overrides win and are easy to keep current.

```bash
om usage pricing show                                   # effective table + snapshot date
om usage pricing set --model gpt-5.5 --input 1.25 --output 10.00   # USD per 1M tokens
om usage pricing reset                                  # drop overrides
```

Overrides live at `~/.config/observational-memory/pricing.toml` (set `OM_PRICING_OVERRIDES` to relocate). Unknown models record token counts with `pricing=unknown` and skip the dollar estimate. `om doctor` reports the tracking state, configured budgets, and the active pricing snapshot.

## Offline reflection with OpenAI Batch

The OpenAI Batch API runs requests offline within a 24-hour window at about half the synchronous per-token price (the same tokens, discounted), on a separate rate-limit pool. Observational Memory can submit a reflection as a Batch job and apply the result later — useful for cutting cost on a metered key and avoiding synchronous timeouts on long reflections.

This is **API-key only**. It works with the direct `openai` provider (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) and is never used for the `openai-chatgpt` subscription provider, which has no Batch API. If your reflector resolves to anything other than `openai`, `--async` errors with a clear message — set `OM_LLM_REFLECTOR_PROVIDER=openai` to use it.

```bash
OM_LLM_REFLECTOR_PROVIDER=openai
om reflect --async        # submit a Batch job and exit (does not write reflections.md yet)
om jobs list              # see recorded jobs and their status
om jobs poll              # apply any completed jobs (safe — see drift below)
om jobs show <job_id>     # inspect one job
om jobs cancel <job_id>   # request cancellation
```

Set `OM_OPENAI_ASYNC_MODE=batch` to make a plain `om reflect` (including scheduled runs) submit async automatically, without the flag.

**Single-pass only.** Batch handles the single-call reflection. If the input is large enough to need chunked folding (each fold depends on the previous output, which a parallel batch can't do), `--async` falls back to running synchronously with a notice — so it's never silently partial.

**Drift safety.** A submitted job records a fingerprint of `reflections.md` and the new observations at submit time. On `om jobs poll`, if either changed since submit (a sync reflect ran, or new observations arrived), the result is **not** applied — it's written to a review artifact next to the job record and the job is marked `drifted`, so a stale consolidation never clobbers newer memory. When state is unchanged, apply runs the full reflect pipeline (stamp, prune, write, trim, reindex) — identical to a synchronous run — records usage at the Batch price, and deletes the uploaded input/output files from OpenAI.

A live smoke test is opt-in and skipped unless `OPENAI_API_KEY` is present with usable billing; see `docs/MAINTAINERS.md`.

### Check for silently-changed facts

`om reflect --check-conflicts` runs a normal reflect and then diffs the prior `reflections.md` against the new one, surfacing high-stakes facts (identity, preferences, policy, decisions, working mode) that the reflector quietly *changed* — so a loosened guardrail or rewritten preference gets a human glance instead of being smoothed over silently.

```bash
om reflect --check-conflicts   # reflect, then print any prior-vs-new conflicts to stderr
om reflect --json              # same, machine-readable report on stdout (implies --check-conflicts)
```

It is **read-only and advisory**: the check itself never edits durable memory and always exits `0`. A human summary goes to stderr; the full report is written to a throwaway file (`om-conflicts-latest.md` in your temp directory, overwritten each run, never synced). Pair with `--dry-run` to preview conflicts without writing the reflect.

The diff is tuned for **precision over recall** — it only flags an unambiguous change to a single durable fact (matching by stable entry id, by one-to-one section/kind slot, or by a single-bullet section), and ignores cosmetic restyling (bold, smart quotes, whitespace, trailing punctuation). A high-stakes fact reworded inside a busy multi-bullet section while its kind also changes is intentionally not flagged, to avoid noise. Gate 1 backups remain the safety net for rolling back any reflect.

## Auth Store

`om login` writes a single host-local file:

```text
~/.config/observational-memory/auth.json   # POSIX
%APPDATA%\observational-memory\auth.json   # Windows
```

The file is created `0600` on POSIX, sits next to the existing env file, is guarded by a cross-process file lock, and never enters OM Cluster sync. Override the location for tests or experiments with `OM_AUTH_FILE=/tmp/auth.json`.

## Memory Paths

Default local memory:

```bash
~/.local/share/observational-memory/
```

Windows default:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\observational-memory\
```

Override the memory directory directly:

```bash
export OM_MEMORY_DIR=~/Documents/obsidian/observation
```

Enable date-rolled observation documents:

```bash
export OM_OBSERVATION_DAILY_DIR=~/Documents/obsidian/observation
```

Or override the base XDG paths:

```bash
export XDG_DATA_HOME=~/my-data
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=~/my-config
```

Important files:

- `observations.md`: recent notes
- `reflections.md`: long-term memory
- `profile.md`: stable startup context
- `active.md`: current startup context
- `.cursor.json`: transcript checkpoints
- `.search-index/`: local search index
- `backups/`: host-local memory snapshots (never synced)

## Memory Backup

OM keeps host-local, versioned snapshots of your memory so a bad reflect or an accidental delete can be rolled back. Before every reflect write, OM takes an automatic `pre-reflect` snapshot of the current (last-good) Markdown. The snapshot step is fail-closed: if it cannot run, reflect still writes and only logs a one-line note.

Each snapshot is one self-contained directory under `backups/` with the four Markdown files plus a `manifest.json` that records a sha256 for each file. Snapshots never include `usage.sqlite`, auth or cluster keys, or the search index — only the authoritative Markdown.

Take an on-demand snapshot, list snapshots, or restore one:

```bash
om backup                 # create a snapshot now
om backup --list          # list snapshots, newest first
om restore --latest       # restore the newest snapshot (asks to confirm)
om restore <snapshot-id>  # restore a specific snapshot
```

Restore is byte-faithful and all-or-nothing: it verifies each file's sha256 against the manifest before overwriting, takes a `pre-restore` safety snapshot first, then stages all files and swaps them in together. If a write fails partway, OM rolls back to the safety snapshot so memory is never left half-restored. Restore brings memory back to the snapshot's exact point in time: files added after the snapshot are removed, and if the snapshot predates `profile.md`/`active.md`, they are regenerated from the restored `reflections.md`. Pass `--yes` to skip the prompt in scripts.

Tune retention and location:

```bash
OM_BACKUP_ENABLED=1            # 1=on (default), 0=disable snapshots
OM_BACKUP_RETENTION_COUNT=20   # keep newest N snapshots; 0 = unlimited
OM_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=0     # also drop snapshots older than N days; 0 = no age limit
OM_BACKUP_DIR=                 # override default (<memory_dir>/backups)
```

`OM_BACKUP_RETENTION_COUNT` counts automatic `pre-reflect` and `pre-restore` snapshots too, so set it high enough to keep the rollback depth you want. Keep `OM_BACKUP_DIR` host-local: never point it at a synced folder (Dropbox, rsync) or a cluster transport dir, because snapshots include `reflections.md`, which can hold `scope=local` entries that must not leave the host.

```bash
OM_PROFILE_INCLUDE_IDENTITY=0
OM_PROFILE_SECTIONS=preferences,relationship,key-facts
```

These settings only narrow generated profile/startup output. They do not turn off observation, reflection, search, recall, or cluster sync.

### Quality: freshness, dedup, and scope

Startup context applies three quality passes so a growing memory corpus stays trustworthy and dense:

- **Deduplication.** A preference or fact appearing in more than one section is shown once — in the highest-priority section — so scarce startup budget isn't spent on repeats.
- **Freshness.** Operational facts (tool versions, install status) get an `(as of <date> — verify)` marker once they're older than `OM_STARTUP_FRESHNESS_DAYS` (default `14`), so the agent knows whether to trust the injected value or check live. Durable preferences and identity facts are never marked.
- **Scope.** When you pass `--cwd` / `--task` (the SessionStart hook does), the matching project gets first claim on the budget; unrelated active-project inventory overflows to recall handles instead of crowding out the current work.

Tune the freshness window (default 14 days) and inspect all three passes with the diagnostic:

```bash
# Mark operational facts older than 7 days, and see the quality report:
OM_STARTUP_FRESHNESS_DAYS=7 om context --quality-report
OM_STARTUP_FRESHNESS_DAYS=7 om context --quality-report --json   # machine-readable
```

It reports duplicate bullets dropped, operational facts that look stale, budget usage per included section, and what overflowed to recall.

## Reflection Metadata

Reflection entries use inline comments like:

```markdown
- Prefer short status updates <!--om: id=ome_abc kind=preference actionability=medium scope=cluster-->
```

Common fields:

- `kind`: `snapshot`, `evergreen`, `preference`, `policy`, `identity`, `task`, `decision`, or `mode`
- `actionability`: `low`, `medium`, or `high`
- `sensitivity`: `normal` or `personal`
- `confidence`: usually `medium`
- `scope`: `cluster` or `local`
- `last_seen`, `last_verified`, `expires`, and `seen_count`

Unknown fields are preserved.

## Schedules

Default schedules:

- Codex observer backstop: every 15 minutes
- Claude observer backstop: every 15 minutes
- Claude auto-memory scan: hourly
- reflector: daily at 04:00 local time

Tune Codex polling:

```bash
OM_CODEX_OBSERVER_INTERVAL_MINUTES=10
```

Tune Claude polling:

```bash
OM_CLAUDE_OBSERVER_INTERVAL_MINUTES=10
```

Tune in-session checkpoints:

```bash
OM_SESSION_OBSERVER_INTERVAL_SECONDS=900
OM_DISABLE_SESSION_OBSERVER_CHECKPOINTS=0
```

Bound background observer workers:

```bash
OM_OBSERVER_WORKER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
OM_OBSERVER_WORKER_LOCK_STALE_SECONDS=360
OM_OBSERVER_WORKER_MAX_RSS_MB=4096
```

Installed hook and scheduler jobs use `om observe-worker`, which allows only
one background observer at a time and stops work that exceeds the timeout or
RSS ceiling. Workers run observer work in a child process that the parent
terminates when it exceeds the timeout or the RSS ceiling. The parent samples
child memory usage with `ps` on macOS and Linux, and with `tasklist` on
Windows. Set `OM_OBSERVER_WORKER_MAX_RSS_MB=0` to disable the RSS ceiling. The ceiling is
a sampled check (about once per second), not a hard allocation limit; if a
memory sample cannot be read or parsed, that sample is skipped rather than
guessed.
Manual `om observe ...` commands are not forced through that background lane.

## Search Backend

Default:

```bash
OM_SEARCH_BACKEND=bm25
```

Optional QMD:

```bash
OM_SEARCH_BACKEND=qmd-hybrid
OM_QMD_INDEX_NAME=observational-memory
OM_QMD_NO_RERANK=1
```

See [search-and-recall.md](search-and-recall.md) for QMD setup.

Optional Moss (cloud semantic search; **opt-in** — uploads memory text to
`service.usemoss.dev`, withholding `scope=local` sections):

```bash
OM_SEARCH_BACKEND=moss
OM_MOSS_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
OM_MOSS_PROJECT_KEY=your-project-key   # secret — never logged or committed
OM_MOSS_INDEX_NAME=observational-memory
# OM_MOSS_MODEL_ID=                     # blank = SDK default (moss-minilm)
# OM_MOSS_ALPHA=                        # blank = SDK default; hybrid blend
```

See [talk-to-memories.md](talk-to-memories.md) for the full Moss + `om talk` guide.

### Talk recall timeout

```bash
OM_TALK_RECALL_TIMEOUT=8.0   # seconds; per-turn wait for background recall
```

`OM_TALK_RECALL_TIMEOUT` (default `8.0`) is how long each `om talk` turn waits
on the background recall before it gives up and grounds the reply without it. A
turn that exceeds this is reported as a timeout (`recall_status="timeout"` in
`--json`), which is kept distinct from a genuinely empty result so the model is
told it could not check memory rather than that memory was empty. The parse is
fail-closed: unset, empty, garbage, or non-positive/non-finite values fall back
to `8.0` and never raise.

## Cluster Flags

Cluster mode is off until local cluster config and keys exist.

Force cluster off for one command:

```bash
OM_CLUSTER_ENABLED=0 om context
```

Useful cluster env overrides:

```bash
OM_CLUSTER_ENABLED=1
OM_CLUSTER_SYNC_BEFORE_CONTEXT=1
OM_CLUSTER_STARTUP_PULL_DEADLINE_MS=1500
```

Relay and filesystem transports remain untrusted. Cluster trust comes from local keys, signatures, membership records, and approval state.

## OM Mail (experimental)

OM Mail exchanges signed memory messages between agents over email inboxes. See [mail-memory.md](mail-memory.md) for the full guide.

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `OM_MAIL_PROVIDER=agentmail` | Mail provider: `agentmail` (default) or `localdir` |
| `OM_AGENTMAIL_API_KEY` | AgentMail API key (required for the `agentmail` provider) |
| `OM_AGENTMAIL_BASE_URL` | AgentMail API base URL (default `https://api.agentmail.to/v0`) |
| `OM_MAIL_LOCALDIR` | Shared message directory for the `localdir` provider |

Mail state — account keys, pinned peers, sync cursor, held messages, opened packs — lives under `<memory_dir>/mail/` (`0600`, host-local, never synced), the same rule as `usage.sqlite` and `.provider-jobs/`.
